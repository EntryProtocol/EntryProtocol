## 📅 Activity Log (Proof of Experience)

### February 2026
- **Feb 15:** Officially established the **EntryProtocol** identity and 5-year roadmap.
- **Feb 17:** Successfully configured GitHub portfolio.  Successfully completed Bandit Levels 0-2. Mastered ('ls'), ('cd'), ('cat'), and handling special filenames. Started Keybr touch-typing (Current focus: Breaking 'one-finger' habit).
- **Feb 18:** Achieved 16.4 WPM @ 92% Accuracy (0% visual reliance). Successfully bypassed hidden files in Level 3 and filtered ASCII text from binary data in Level 4. Mastered 'ls -a' and 'file' commands.
- **Feb 19:** Accomplished major Technical & Physical milestones.
  - **Technical:** Mastered system-wide searching from the Root (`/`) and Data (`/var`) directories. 
  - **Logic:** Learned to filter 'Search Noise' from the `/proc` virtual filesystem and redirect errors using `2>/dev/null`.
  - **Typing:** Breakthrough session. Reached 23.8 WPM @ 94.44% Accuracy (100% blind).
  - **Strategy:** Practiced 'Tactical Pausing' to ensure full retention of complex Linux command structures.
- **Feb 20:** Tactical Pause. Reviewing command logic for 'grep' and 'piping' in preparation for Mission Day 5.
- **Feb 21:** Accomplished major Technical & Physical milestones.
  - **Technical:** Mastered 'In-File' data extraction in Bandit Levels 7-8. 
  - **Logic:** Implemented 'wc -l' for file-size pre-verification. Created complex command chains using 'sort', 'uniq -u', and 'grep' with pipes.
  - **Strategy:** Developed a 'Keyword Dictionary' (pass, admin, config) for targeted Red Team reconnaissance.
  - **Typing:** Milestone reached. 29.1 WPM @ 97% Accuracy (100% blind). Speed increased by 80% since Day 1.
- **Feb 22:** Successfully completed Bandit levels 8-10. Learnt ('strings') and ('base64') encoding. Practiced 10 minutes on keybr and reached 32.4 wpm @ 96% accuracy (blind typing).
- **Feb 24:**
- Accomplished Bandit levels 10-12. Learnt and implemented ('base64') and ('tr'). Connected ('tr') with ('A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'). Differenciated between 'Encoding' and 'Encryption'. Understood the concept of 'ROT13'.
  -**Typing**: Successfully increased in 34.6 wpm @ 98.7% accuracy for 10 minutes.
  -**Extra**: Started mini Python side quests to develop a better understanding and master the basics for future scripting. Today's side quest: Completed an Odd/Even checker where you enter a number and the output checks whether it's an odd number or even. Implemented on ('input()'), variables and conditionals with depth of if/else.
- **Feb 25:** Finally reached the Silver milestone of above 40 wpm. I successfully reached 43.1 wpm @ 97.54% accuracy while practicing for 15 minutes today. I didn't do any extra bandit levels but I focused and implemented more on yesterday's new commands and concepts.
- **Feb 27:** Successfully completed bandit levels 12-13.
- **Key Technical Achievements:**
    - **Workspace Provisioning:** Utilized `/tmp/` to bypass restricted home directory permissions and establish a functional **temporary workbench**.
    - **Binary Reconstruction:** Applied `xxd -r` to revert **Hexdumps** into original binary formats.
    - **Signature Identification:** Leveraged the `file` command to perform **MIME-type analysis** and identify true file identities (Gzip, Bzip2, Tar).
    - **Decompression Pipeline:** Executed an iterative loop of `gunzip`, `bunzip2`, and `tar -xf` to peel back nested obfuscation layers.
    - **File Management:** Mastered the use of `mv` for tool-specific renaming and `ls -lt` for tracking the latest extracted artifacts.
- **Red Team Skill Unlocked:** *Environmental Awareness & Iterative Data Forensics
  -Skipped typing practice for today.
